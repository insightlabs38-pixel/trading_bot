# Phase 3 Progress — CPU Data Pipeline

Last updated: **2026-08-18**

Status: **IN PROGRESS**

This file records validation detail for Phase 3. The authoritative task list remains
`IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`.

## Vendor acquisition

- [x] Provider-independent `VendorAdapter` interface.
- [x] Canonical immutable vendor request schema with stable SHA-256 identity.
- [x] Bounded transient retry/backoff.
- [x] Request-rate limiting with deterministic test hooks.
- [x] Raw vendor payloads are preserved byte-for-byte under content-addressed immutable keys.
- [x] Exact request parameters, download timestamp, vendor source ID, response metadata, size,
  and checksum are persisted for every successful acquisition.
- [x] Repeated identical payloads reuse the immutable raw object while retaining distinct download
  audit records.
- [ ] **BLOCKED — broad-equities provider adapter:** final vendor subscription/API contract is not
  available in the sandbox, so the planned Massive/Polygon-style adapter cannot be implemented or
  integration-tested responsibly yet.
- [ ] **BLOCKED — execution-data provider adapter:** a Databento/equivalent selection and credentials
  are not available, so that provider-specific adapter remains deferred.

## Validation performed

The new vendor-acquisition tests plus the complete Phase 2 storage suite pass in the dedicated
sandbox venv:

```text
42 passed
```

`compileall` passes and the new files satisfy the repository's 100-character line-length policy.
Git blob hashes were checked against the exact sandbox-tested files before merge.

The external-provider blockers do not prevent the next section, **Raw validation**, from being
implemented and tested against synthetic fixtures.
